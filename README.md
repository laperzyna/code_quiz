## Main 
This program is a Javascript Code Quiz Game. It has four multiple choice questions, a timer that runs down from 60, an end page with a score submission form asking for initials, a score display, indicators on whether the question was answered correctly or incorrectly, and multiple home buttons.

## What I struggled with
This assignment was super difficult and I struggled with it a lot. You'll probably be able to notice that I wasn't able to set/get the local storage so I was not able to set the high scores list. I was also not able to display the final score on the screen. I'm not sure why it doesn't display because it was originally but after console.logging I discovered that the variable wasn't reading correctly at all and displayed a 0, even though it displayed correctly throughout the game. I think if I had more time I'd be able to figure out these mistakes but it's all good. I'm sure I'll come back to it eventually.!
